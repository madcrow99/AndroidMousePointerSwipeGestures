# AndroidMousePointerSwipeGestures
A simple accessibility app that allows alternative pointers to perform swipe gestures 

This app is designed for users with motor impairments to perform swipe gestures while using their preferred mouse/pointing device. The app is useful while using dwell cicking. The app consists of 4 arrow shped buttons (left, up, down, right) that are diplayed above all other windows.

To enable the app, turn it on and accept the warning. The app will be available under the accessibility settings.

This project was based on an amazing Android codelab Tutorial. I encourage you to take a look as it provides lots of great information about accessibility features and how to implement them in Android.
